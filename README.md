# Shotegoriesbot
A discord bot made with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) using the [shotegories API](https://git.graesbgerg.com/Shotegories)

It supplies two commands, ```/category``` which responds with a random category and ```/shotegory``` which does the same, but also supplies a letter 1 second later to narrow down your possible responses
